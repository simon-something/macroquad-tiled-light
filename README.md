## CI & deployment

This repo includes the following CI:
- cargo fmt (blocking)
- cargo check
- cargo clippy (blocking)
- cargo test (for linux, macos and windows)
- cargo coverage (will post the result as an (auto-updated) PR comment)
- cargo docs generation

- cargo audit (checking for imported crates with known vulnerabilities)

This repo follows [trunk based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/), where `main` contains all the released versions, using tags to trigger deployments.

The CI will deploy on both crates.io and as a github release all push on main which
are tagged with a valid semver preceded by `v` (`git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release X.Y.Z"` then `git push vX.Y.Z` on dev).
This deployment needs an env secret `CRATES_API_TOKEN` to be set in the repo settings as well as a "prod" environement (case sensitive),  with a protection rule on the branch `main` and on the `v*.*.*` pattern tag.

## Suggestions

- Run clippy on the whole codebase using: `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` (CI is doing this by default)
